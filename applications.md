# Applications

This page contains my recommendations for applications / apps on desktop and mobile devices.
I divided them by use case and for some I provide different alternatives for different platforms.

## Password Manager

I use `pass` exclusively to manage my password. It is a simple but elegant password manager for
tech-savvy people and uses battle-tested technologies like git and PGP. More information about
this you can find on https://www.passwordstore.org/.

There are many clients and GUIs for different plattforms, I used the following ones:

### [Desktop] QtPass

> üõà I only used this on Linux and can't say anything about the other platforms.

* Website: https://qtpass.org/
* GitHub: https://github.com/IJHack/QtPass

### [iOS] Pass for iOS

It is a bit complicated to set this up, because you have to generate the ssh key on a different
device and then transfer the private key to you device somehow. The same is true for the pgp key.
But after that it integrates nicely into the system.

## File Syncing

I prefer to have my files locally and not in the cloud per default. Therefore I use an approach to
keep my devices in sync with each other. I use Syncthing for this.
Read more about it on https://syncthing.net/.

### [Desktop] Syncthing

Simply simply use syncthing itself. It is managed via a web interface. The url to that is a bookmark
in my browser.

### [iOS] M√∂bius Sync

This app costs a bit of money, if you want to use it effectively, but until now I didn't have any
problems with it and it is worth the one-time payment imho, because syncing stuff is quite important
for me and this allows me to do that.

### [Android] Syncthing
